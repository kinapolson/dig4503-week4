\nLocal File Reader

For my first MCP server, I created a tool that allows Claude to read text files from a directory on your local computer called the Local File Reader. This is useful because it allows Claude to access notes, logs, datasets, etc without having to manually copy and pasting content. It also improves workflow, allowing developers working with code and other documents to complete tasks at a more efficient rate.

Installation Instructions:
1. Have a coding environment installed on your computer
2. Download the project from GitHub
3. Open the project folder on your computer
4. Install any required files.
5. Start the server
6. Open Claude and type “/mcp” and select the tools.
7. Add or connect the Local File Reader
8. Use the tool to access text files from the selected directory.

Usages:
-Read notes.txt file using Local File Reader tool to summarize
-Access data.txt file using Local File Reader tool to organize data

Limitations:
Tool can only read files within the selected directory
